<h1>InstaVisualization</h1>

(Slowly) working on a project that integrates cloudy_vision: https://github.com/goberoi/cloudy_vision
and instagram-scraper https://github.com/rarcega/instagram-scraper
in order to allow a user to enter any Instagram username (with a public account), and be able to see some interesting data analytics/visualizations on all of their pictures using Google Cloud Vision. This can enable users to make informed decisions on an Instagram user without having to scroll through each photo.
<br>
First, add an ```api_keys.json``` file with your google api-key:

`{
    "google" : "<insert google API-KEY here>"
}`

<br>Update: needed to use instagram-scraper as this was implemented initially using Instagram's old API. More to come soon.
